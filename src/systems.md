The two main systems that we study in this work are quantum dots and nuclei.  Quantum dots are a remarkably simple system for studying quantum phenomena and provide a testbed for both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements.  In contrast, nuclei are significantly more complex and their interactions play a much stronger role.

For simplicity, we begin with quantum dots and use it to test the effectiveness of our many-body methods.  Ultimately, nuclei are the more challenging and intriguing system to study, and they tend to be more practically relevant.
