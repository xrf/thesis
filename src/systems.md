The two main systems that we study in this work are quantum dots and nuclei.  Quantum dots are a remarkably simple system for studying quantum phenomena and provide a testbed for both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements as the strength of its correlations can be easily tuned by adjusting the width of the external trap.  In contrast, nuclei are natural, self-bound systems with a nuclear force that is both complicated and uncertain.

For simplicity, we begin with quantum dots and use it to test the effectiveness of our many-body methods.  Ultimately, nuclei are the more challenging and intriguing system to study, and they tend to be more practically relevant.
