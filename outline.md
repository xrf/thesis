# Addition and removal energies of quantum many-body systems

## Introduction

## Many-body methods

### Foundations

### Hartree-Fock theory

### In-medium similarity renormalization group methods

### Perturbation methods

## Many-body systems

### Quantum dot

### Infinite nuclear matter

NB: it's kind of hard to talk about methods without considering a specific system

### Neutron drop?

### Electron gas?

## Implementation

### Functional programming

## Conclusions
